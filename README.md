# EmployeeFinder

EmployeeFinder is a full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

Express was used to handle routing.

## Deployment

The app is deployed to heroku and is available on the link below:

## Instructions


* Your survey should have 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.
* Your `server.js` file should require the basic npm packages we've used in class: `express` and `path`.
* Your `htmlRoutes.js` file should include two routes:

  * A GET Route to `/survey` which should display the survey page.
  * A default, catch-all route that leads to `home.html` which displays the home page. 

* Your `apiRoutes.js` file should contain two routes:

  * A GET route with the url `/api/employees`. This will be used to display a JSON of all possible employees.
  * A POST routes `/api/employees`. This will be used to handle incoming survey results. This route will also be used to handle the       compatibility logic. 

* Once you've found the current user's most compatible employee, display the result as a modal pop-up.
    * The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.
